# RFID Attendance Project

This application can be used to capture participants attendance to a meeting or event using a RFID Read/Write device and tag.  
The partcipant will need to be assigned a RFID Tag and their information associated with that tag in one table in the database.
A second table will log the Tag Id and the timestamp for each tag as it is read by the reader.  A report can be generated via HTML
in a browser and/or emailed to the organizer at the end of the session.
